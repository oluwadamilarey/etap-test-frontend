# Learning App Frontend

## Project Description

The Learning App is a web application designed to facilitate online learning by allowing users to explore subjects and their associated topics. Users can create subjects, view topics under each subject, and access detailed information about each topic, including videos and descriptions. The application also tracks learners' progress and allows admin users to view rankings based on topic completion rates.

### Key Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user login and registration with role-based access control.
- **Subject Management**: Users can create, update, and delete subjects.
- **Topic Management**: Users can view topics related to a subject, create new topics, and manage existing ones.

## Tech Stack
